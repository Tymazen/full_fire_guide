# How to not die
Overall fire's typical defensive gameplay is __proactive__ not reactive. We want to preemptively use defensives to incoming damage, not during or after it. Fire prefers to use our 0GCD defensives when inside [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) as much as possible, holding our on-gcd defensives for times in filler, and pre-using them before entering [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) if we wont have a 0GCD defensive available for it. It's a guaranteed DPS loss to use on-gcd defensives in [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) and should only be done if you know you're going to die.

1. [Alter Time](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108978/alter-time) This is 0GCD, a 50 second cooldown before accounting for [Shifting Power](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=382440/shifting-power), and hands down one of the strongest buttons in the entire game. It's our go to defensive used inside [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) if you wont get one shot, as you can and should use both of its start and end when casting an instant spell. Thus not interrupting your damage at all.
2. [Ice Cold](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=414658/ice-cold) This is 0GCD as well, and our "oh-shit" button for inside [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) if something will one shot us and [Alter time](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108978/alter-time) or isn't enough. Beware it's a very long cooldown. 4 minutes base without [Winter's Protection](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=382424/winters-protection) talented or accounting for [Shifting Power](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=382440/shifting-power) reduction.
3. [Ice Block](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=45438/ice-block) This is an immune, and more often than not a sub-par version of its above variant. We only take this if we specifically need to immune something.
4. [Blazing Barrier](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=235313/blazing-barrier) Our bread and butter defensive with a very short cooldown of 25 seconds. Applying this in filler when you know damage will be coming __before__ you enter [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) or [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing) is the best manner to use this. You should only ever use this inside [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) or [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing) if you will guaranteed die if you do not use it.
5. [Mass Barrier](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=414660/mass-barrier) Follows the same rules as [Blazing Barrier](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=235313/blazing-barrier) above, 2 minute cooldown, although can be used to help your teammates out in a pinch too.
6. [Mirror Image](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=321686/mirror-image) Follows the same rules as [Blazing Barrier](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=235313/blazing-barrier), with a small caveat that while this is purely a defensive, you can use it pre-pull or during high damage amp phases to squeeze a tiny fraction of DPS out more. This is the one defensive I try to get used as close to on cooldown as possible because it does do a very tiny fraction of DPS, and if you aren't maxing, you're minning.
7. [Greater Invisibility](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=110959/greater-invisibility) is our "oh-shit" button for outside of [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion), and like the others should only ever be used inside [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) if you will guaranteed die without it.
