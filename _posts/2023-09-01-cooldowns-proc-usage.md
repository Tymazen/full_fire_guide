# Cooldown Usage

Typically we want to use our cooldowns as close to on cooldown as possible. Holding these usually results in an overall DPS loss.
- [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) We use this on cooldown unless we currently have the [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) buff from another source, or we wont get to DPS the full 12 seconds because the pack will die, the boss will fly away, etc.
- [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing) We use this as soon as it's available regardless of whether we currently have [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) or not unless we wont get to DPS the full 6 seconds because the pack will die, the boss will fly away, etc.
- [Meteor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=153561/meteor) We use this as long as it will hit all mobs and will land inside [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion). However we may want to use it in filler in a few specific scenarios, say when a trash pack is about to die and we have a long role play scenario afterwards. At this point its more valuable to simply get it used and get it back than it is to hold it, even though it didn't land inside [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion). Also note, there will be times where it's better to hold [Meteor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=153561/meteor) for a little. An example of this would be if using it now causes it to impact one target, but using it in 20 seconds causes it to hit 5 targets, thus getting 5x the value. Use your noodle and land it on as many targets as possible within each "usage" time frame!
- [Flame Accelerant](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=203275/flame-accelerant) In filler we pay no attention to this, but inside [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) we want to use this as soon as its available, provided we wont munch SKB stacks. As you saw previously this makes [Fireball](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=133/fireball) hit harder than a [Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast)!
- [Shifting Power](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=382440/shifting-power) Early in filler as long as [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) has 16 seconds or more left on cooldown, and as long as we wont or can prevent overcap on [Fireblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast) charges.
