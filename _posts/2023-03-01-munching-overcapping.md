# What the hell is munching?
Munching is taking an action that causes you to gain a stack of something that you are already at maximum stacks of, causing you to lose the stack you just generated.

Examples:
- Casting [Fireblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast) while you have [Heating Up](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48107/heating-up), and have a generator already in flight that will convert it into [Hot Streak](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=195283/hot-streak).
- Consuming a [Hot Streak](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=195283/hot-streak) when you already have 8 stacks of [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing)
- Using a third [Heating up](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48107/heating-up) generator and losing the [Heating up]((https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48107/heating-up)) because you already have [Hot Streak](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=195283/hot-streak) and did not consume it.

### Okay, what's overcapping?
Overcapping is having a resource sit at its maximum stacks for any duration of time, thus not being on cooldown. A very simple example of this would be:
- I have three  charges of [Fireblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast), they recharge every 10 seconds (made up number). I don't use my first charge for 10 seconds because I don't know any better. I then use it.
- What has occurred here is I got to use one charge of [Fireblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast) in a 10 second window, when in reality I could've gotten to use two. The first charge at the start, and a second charge 10 seconds later.
- This adds up over a fight. In this particular example, for every 10 seconds total I overcap on [Fireblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast) charges, I lose a usage. Even if I'm only overcapping for 1 to 2 seconds at a time, if I consistently do this for a grand total of 60 seconds, I've lost 6 uses of that spell.

Thus, overcapping resources is very bad and loses us uses of a said resource down the line.
