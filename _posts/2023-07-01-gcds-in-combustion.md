# GCD's in Combustion

### Overcap Prevention
Overcapping anything is always bad, as you lose CDR and thus uses of a spell throughout a fight. Overcapping [Fireblasts](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast) is the worst thing you can possibly do. Preventing this is very simple. If you are about to overcap [Fireblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast) charges, use a [Fireblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast)>[Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast). This may commonly be needed at the very beginning of [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) or in very high haste scenarios. Otherwise, following the rules and 3GCD combo playstyle outlined throughout the guide will outright prevent the issue.


### The 3GCD Combos:
Practice this!

Here's the magic trick! Using these frequently allows you to follow all of your prios, maintain your buffs, and use your procs without a super brain as you can commit these to muscle memory. This playstyle drastically reduces the mental load required to perform your rotation as you're making decisions once every 3GCD's for the most part, where as with the more fluid playstyle you frequently have to make snap decisions GCD to GCD.

 Deciding which set of combos to use is very simple.
- Use the [Scorch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2948/scorch) combo if you need to refresh [Improved Scorch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383604/improved-scorch) (Usually around 4 seconds left on it)
- Use the [Flame Accelerant](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=203275/flame-accelerant) combo if it's available
- Use one of the [Phoenix Flames](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=194466/phoenixs-flames) combos if you have charges to spend, and are not talented into [Alexstrasza's Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=235870/alexstraszas-fury)
- Use the [Scorch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2948/scorch) combo if you don't have [Flame Accelerant](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=203275/flame-accelerant) or [Phoenix Flames](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=194466/phoenixs-flames) to spend. (If you havent picked up on it yet, this combo is going to be used __a lot!__)

When should I use these combos? (HINT: MOST OF THE TIME)
- If you won't munch [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing) stacks
- During [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) when you wont overcap [Fireblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast) charges. Remember, these only work inside [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion)!!

**The Combos:**

### SKB Odd/Even Track
Practice this!

We will always have either odd or even amounts of SKB stacks while in [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion), and it's important to make note of this. We will simply play as normal preventing overcap, and using the 3GCD combo's until we're at 7 or 8 SKB stacks. If you have 8 just enter [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing). If you're at 7, use one of the below 1 [Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast) combo's to track swap to 8. Our prefrence here would be [Phoenix Flames](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=194466/phoenixs-flames)>[Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast) if it's available and we are not talented into [Alexstrasza's Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=235870/alexstraszas-fury), although we more commonly use [Scorch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2948/scorch)>[Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast); and albeit uncommon, if we're lucky and flush on [Fireblasts](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast) we can use [Fireblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast)>[Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast).

- [Phoenix Flames](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=194466/phoenixs-flames)>[Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast)

### The anatomy of Combustion
Practice this!

The typical anatomy of Combustion is similar to playing with legos. It's made up of various small combinations that we can commit to muscle memory. We use cursory information just by glancing at our bars once during our entries or 3GCD combos and quickly and effeciently decide on what to do inside our [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) while freeing up bandwidth for mechanics and more!

Typically it looks like this:
- Proper [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) Entry
- Overcap Prevention if needed
- 3GCD combos until 7 or 8 stacks of SKB or until you have 2 or less GCD's remaining
- SKB track swap if on 7 SKB stacks
- Finish on a [Hotstreak](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48108/hot-streak) consumption or [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing) hardcast

![bust_anatomy](https://github.com/Tymazen/images/assets/67207109/e1f94ccf-9a8b-4ab4-9ac0-a6e118a49041)

![5SKB_stack_bust_entry_example](https://github.com/Tymazen/images/assets/67207109/e32a94d7-2628-4bb8-8f83-05d59b001a3d)

Overall [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) will always result in you obtaining at-least one [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing) and sometimes more, depending on how many stacks you started with as long as you have 25% or more haste.

### Finishing Combustion/SKB
Practice this!

Because of the way fire's spells are coded we can consume a [Hot Streak](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48108/hot-streak) with [Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast) or [Flamestrike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2120/flamestrike) on a partial GCD and it still get the full [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) buff on impact regardless of travel time. This works similarly for casted spells, as long as the cast has finished before [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) has ended, the spells will have the [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) buff regardless of elongated travel time or them impacting outside of [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion). Do note, [Phoenix Flames](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=194466/phoenixs-flames) is unique in the aspect that it is calculated on impact, not when it leaves.

What this means, is that every [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) should end with it's last whole or partial GCD being a consumed [Hot Streak](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48108/hot-streak), or a  [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing) being hardcast and thus extending it. Every [Sun King's blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing) or extensions, should end with it's last whole or partial GCD being a consumed [Hot Streak](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48108/hot-streak).

This can be a little tricky at first, luckily a good friend of mine has the perfect weakaura for this! Check out Forgy's [Final Bust GCD Helper](https://wago.io/MTxeqnJE1), read the description, and leverage it to it's full value!

### GCD Math
[Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) when talented into [Improved Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383967/improved-combustion) gives 12 seconds of [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion). [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing) gives 6 seconds of [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion). We can calculate out how many GCD's we get for each of these at any haste levels with some simple math. (Time/(GCD Base/(1+haste)))
 - [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) GCD calculation at 40% haste: 12/(1.5/1.4) = 12/1.07 = 11.21 GCD's in [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion)
- [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing) GCD calculation at 40% haste: 6/(1.5/1.4) = 6/1.07 = 5.6 GCD's in [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing)

Full breakpoints:
- Base haste: 8 GCD's in [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion), 4 in [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing)
- 12.5% Haste: 9 GCD's in [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion), 4.5 in [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing)
- 25% Haste: 10 GCD's in [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion), 5 in [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing)
- 37.5% Haste: 11 GCD's in [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion), 5.5 in [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing)
- 50% Haste: 12 GCD's in [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion), 6 in [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing)
- 62.5% Haste: 13 GCD's in [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion), 6.5 in [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing)
- 75% Haste: 14 GCD's in [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion), 7 in [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing)
- 87.5% Haste: 15 GCD's in [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion), 7.5 in [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing)
- 100% Haste: 16 GCD's in [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion), 8 in [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing)

The GCD can only be reduced to 0.75s and not any further. This means that after 100% Haste, you no longer gain any GCD's in [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) or [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing).

As mentioned earlier, because of the nature of fire's spells, we can abuse the way they are coded to take advantage of partial GCD's. All this means is if i'm at 30% haste, I still get 11 GCD's worth of spells in [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) and 6 GCD's worth of spells in [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing).

While it's not imperative to your performance, this knowledge is how we're able to break the gameplay down into easier combos and formats for you to use!

### Sun King's Blessing Anatomy
Practice this!

SKB's anatomy follows the very same format as [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) with a bit more focus on the partial GCD at the end. Whether the partial GCD needs one last [Fireblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast)>[Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast) will change as gear values increase or decrease through tiers, but i'll keep this section updated with current normal gearing thresholds.

Typically it looks like this:
- Proper Entry
- 3GCD combo
- [Fireblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast)>[Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast) for the last half GCD. (It's only in hu-SKB's for current content/gearing)

![skb_anatomy](https://github.com/Tymazen/images/assets/67207109/8e0c95f2-5882-4bd8-abde-0704ee27f399)

You should be getting an exact amount of [Pyroblasts](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast) out of your stand-alone [Sun King's Blessings](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing). You should get 5 from a [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing) you entered with [Heating up](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48107/heating-up) and 4 from one you entered without [Heating up](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48107/heating-up). If you're using [Meteor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=153561/meteor) with your [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing) you will only get 4 [Pyroblasts](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast) with a [Heating up](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48107/heating-up) SKB and still 4 with a no-hu SKB. Remember when you have haste buffs from mechanics, [Time Warp](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=80353/time-warp), [Power Infusion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=265314/power-infusion), etc you'll get more GCD's thus more [Pyroblasts](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast) !
