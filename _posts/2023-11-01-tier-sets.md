# Set Bonuses:
- The current [T31 tier set](https://www.wowhead.com/item-set=1562/wayward-chronomancers-clockwork) has no impact on our rotation what so ever and is best just ignored.
- In Fated, with the return of the [T30 tier set](https://www.wowhead.com/item-set=1545/underlight-conjurers-brilliance) we will have slight rotation changes to filler and managing [Phoenix Flames](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=194466/phoenixs-flames) overcap, but I'll push that live when the time comes.
