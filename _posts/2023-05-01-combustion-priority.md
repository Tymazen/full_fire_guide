# The Prio

### What's our goal in Combustion?
To do as much damage as possible! This means using all of our hardest hitting spells inside [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion), and consuming as many [Hot Streaks](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48108/hot-streak) as possible!

### Spell Damages:
- [Fury of the Sun King Hardcast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383883/fury-of-the-sun-king) - [Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast) Hardcast: 713.67912% of Spell Power - 2.3 GCD's or [Flamestrike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2120/flamestrike) Hardcast: 261.3757428% of Spell power up to 8 targets - 2 GCD's
- [Meteor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=153561/meteor) - 296.01% of Spell Power - 1 GCD

### When to Pyroblast versus Flamestrike
- For [Ignite](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=12654/ignite) or Single Target builds, you use [Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast) to consume [Hot Streak](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48108/hot-streak) and to hardcast for [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing)
- For Hybrid builds, you consume [Hot Streak](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48108/hot-streak) with [Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast) if there is a priority target at any target count, otherwise at 3 targets or less. You consume [Hot Streak](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48108/hot-streak) with [Flamestrike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2120/flamestrike) at 4 targets or more as long as there is no priority target. You hardcast [Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast) for [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing) at 2 targets or less, and hardcast [Flamestrike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2120/flamestrike) for [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing) at 3 targets or more.
- For [Flamestrike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2120/flamestrike) AOE Builds, you consume [Hot Streak](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48108/hot-streak) with [Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast) at 3 targets or less, and consume [Hot Streak](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48108/hot-streak) with [Flamestrike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2120/flamestrike) at 4 targets or more.

### Priority:
The way we play would be as if we were reading this list from the top down, every ms, and actioning on the highest item on the list available at the time
- Maintain all Buffs without munching [Feel The Burn](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383391/feel-the-burn), [Improved Scorch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383604/improved-scorch)(If talented), Etc
- Hardcast [Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast) or [Flamestrike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2120/flamestrike) for [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing) as appropriate
- Cast [Meteor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=153561/meteor) as long as it will land before [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) has ended.
- Hardcast for [Fireball](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=133/fireball) with a [Flame Accelerant](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=203275/flame-accelerant) proc, as long as it will finish before [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) has ended
- Consume [Hot Streak](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48108/hot-streak) with [Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast) or [Flamestrike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2120/flamestrike) as appropriate
- Cast [Fireblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast) to convert [Heating up](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48107/heating-up) to [Hot Streak](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48108/hot-streak) as aggressively as possible without dropping [Feel the Burn](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383391/feel-the-burn)
- Cast all [Phoenix Flames](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=257541/phoenix-flames) charges when talented into [From the Ashes](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=342344/from-the-ashes) or talented into neither [From the Ashes](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=342344/from-the-ashes) or [Alexstrasza's Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=235870/alexstraszas-fury), to convert [Heating Up](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48107/heating-up) to [Hot Streak](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48108/hot-streak)
- Cast [Scorch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2948/scorch) if none of the above

Note: Replace all [Scorches](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2948/scorch) with [Fireball](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=133/fireball) when your haste exceeds 100%, except the minimum amounts of [Scorches](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2948/scorch) required to maintain [Improved Scorch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383604/improved-scorch)

Okay dude, I'm not a friggin super computer. I can't go down that list multiple times between each button press, what gives?

### Combustion Prio rewritten:
This is a lot more simple than it looks. So let's break it down for a person to read, not a computer. Don't give up just yet, I promise by the time you've finished all the Combustion parts you'll be able to pull this off with a bit of practice.
- Don't drop your buffs, don't munch and don't overcap [Fireblasts](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast)
- Hardcast [Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast) or [Flamestrike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2120/flamestrike) for [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing) as appropriate
- Cast [Meteor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=153561/meteor) as long as it will land inside [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion)
- Use 3GCD combos (These make it so you're following rule 1!)

Note: all [Scorches](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2948/scorch) get swapped to [Fireballs](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=133/fireball) when your haste exceeds 100% (in double lust) except what few are required to maintain [Improved Scorch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383604/improved-scorch) if you are in [Searing Touch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=269644/searing-touch).

__Special Note:__ [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) and [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing) have unique interactions with each other you should be aware of.
  - [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) should not ever be cast while you have the [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) buff currently active from any other source, as the spell resets your buff to 12 seconds. Meaning it will completely overwrite what you have left thus losing you those few seconds of buff time.
  - [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing) should always be casted as soon as possible, as it __adds__ 6 additional seconds to your [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) buff.

That's the prio! I'll be covering more on **how** to pull this off without a super computer for a brain over the next few sections, so bear with me!
