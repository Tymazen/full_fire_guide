# Filler
Practice This!

   Filler is simply when we are not inside [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) or [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing). We're looking to achieve 3 objectives while in filler:

### Goals:
- Using [Shifting Power](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=382440/shifting-power) as long as [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) has 16 seconds or more left on its cooldown and you wont overcap [Fireblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast) charges. We want to get this used as close to on cooldown as possible in filler.  
- Building [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing) stacks. We do this via entering a loop of chain casting [Fireballs](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=133/fireball) waiting for [Heating up's](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48107/heating-up) to occur. We do not wait and see if the previous [Fireball](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=133/fireball) generated one, we continue to chain cast. We will get a [Heating up](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48107/heating-up) mid-cast of a [Fireball](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=133/fireball) at which point we convert it to [Hot Streak](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48108/hot-streak) with a [Fireblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast) and queue a [Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast) or [Flamestrike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2120/flamestrike) into the end of the [Fireball](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=133/fireball) cast. This is commonly known as "fishing."
- "Pooling" of [Fireblasts](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast) for our next [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) or [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing). Pooling is simply saving them at the apporpraite time to meet the minimums required to perform a full [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) and/or [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing). We need 1.8+ [Fireblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast) charges for [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) and 1.8+ [Fireblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast) charges for [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing). We achieve this by stopping spending [Fireblasts](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast) to convert around 6 SKB stacks, and/or 7-10 seconds out from [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) coming off of cooldown. So we maintain our [Fireball](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=133/fireball) chain casting, but simply stop spending [Fireblasts](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast) until we either get a natural double crit, or we've saved enough charges to convert __and__ meet our pooling requirements.


### Alexstrasza's Fury (AF)
With AF we have two additional generators to use in Filler. [Phoenix Flames](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=257541/phoenix-flames) and [Dragon's Breath](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=31661/dragons-breath)
- [Phoenix Flames](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=257541/phoenix-flames) we simply use before or after our [Fireball](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=133/fireball) filler chain loop. We do not cast [Phoenix Flames](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=257541/phoenix-flames) directly after a [Fireball](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=133/fireball), but instead use it either before we enter the chain cast loop, or use it after a consumed [Hot Streak](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48108/hot-streak). This prevents us from munching or creating gaps in our DPS
- [Dragon's Breath]((https://www.wowhead.com/spell=31661/dragons-breath)) is situational. If it needs to be held for a stop, like in Mythic+, you would hold it for the stop. Otherwise you can use it in filler to generate a [Heating up](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48107/heating-up) or [Hot Streak](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48108/hot-streak) following the same rules as [Phoenix flames](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=257541/phoenix-flames)
- The caveat to AF filler, you don't have to [Fireball](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=133/fireball) with every [Hot Streak](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48108/hot-streak). If you have enough resources between [Fireblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast), [Phoenix Flames](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=257541/phoenix-flames), and [Dragon's Breath](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=31661/dragons-breath) to reach your next [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing) while still meeting [Fireblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast) pooling requirements, you can just send them swiftly without the need to [Fireball](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=133/fireball)

### Searing Touch
While in [Searing Touch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=269644/searing-touch) we no longer use [Fireball](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=133/fireball) filler, and simply use [Scorch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2948/scorch) and any other generators we have to generate [Heating up](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48107/heating-up) and [Hot Streak](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48108/hot-streak) then consume it with [Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast) or [Flamestrike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2120/flamestrike). We do still follow pooling requirements and use [Shifting Power](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=382440/shifting-power) as normal
