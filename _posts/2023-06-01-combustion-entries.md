# The Entries
Practice these!

### Why?
The way you enter [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) or [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing) matters. Entering it correctly sets you up to do the maximum damage possible, ensures you have no gaps in DPS, and is almost entirely scripted. Practice these until you do them perfectly, always. Oh yea, remember that double pyro trick we discussed really early on? Yep she's back, and she's **required.** So I hope you practiced it!

### Entry Format
- Hardcast
- Press [Fireblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast) once during the hardcast to generate [Heating Up](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48107/heating-up) or convert it to [Hot Streak](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48108/hot-streak) (Caveat, never convert to [Hot Streak](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48108/hot-streak) when hardcasting [Flamestrike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2120/flamestrike))
- Press [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) as late as possible during the hardcast without breaking queuing or having gaps
- [Scorch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2948/scorch) if you do not have [Hot Streak](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48108/hot-streak)
- Consume your [Hot Streaks](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48108/hot-streak) with [Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast) or [Flamestrike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2120/flamestrike)

The hardcast can be:
- [Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast) or [Flamestrike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2120/flamestrike) if you have [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing) ready.
- [Scorch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2948/scorch) if you just casted [Meteor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=153561/meteor) or need to maintain [Improved Scorch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383604/improved-scorch)
- [Fireball](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=133/fireball) if none of the above, use in place of **ALL** [Scorches](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2948/scorch) when haste is > 100% unless they are specifically being used to maintain [Improved Scorch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383604/improved-scorch)

### **What about Meteor and Living Bomb?**
- If you are talented into [Meteor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=153561/meteor) you will use it at any target count as long as it is available.
- Cast [Meteor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=153561/meteor) as the GCD before entering combustion if you do not have [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing), and use [Scorch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2948/scorch) as your hardcast if below 100% haste (use [Fireball](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=133/fireball) otherwise) so [Meteor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=153561/meteor) lands inside combustion.
- Cast [Meteor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=153561/meteor) instead of [Scorch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2948/scorch) as your first GCD in [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) if you could not pre-cast it, and did not have a [Heating up](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48107/heating-up) when starting your entry
- Cast [Meteor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=153561/meteor) between your double [Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast) or [Flamestrike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2120/flamestrike) if you had [Heating up](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48107/heating-up) when starting your entry and could not precast it before entering.

- Cast [Living Bomb](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=44457/living-bomb) as the GCD before [Meteor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=153561/meteor) if using it, otherwise as the GCD before starting your [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) entry only when 5 targets or more are present. Never cast [Living Bomb](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=44457/living-bomb) inside [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion).
