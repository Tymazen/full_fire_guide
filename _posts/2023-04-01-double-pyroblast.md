# Isn't this kind of like cheating?
Not at all, and make sure to practice this!

- So why are we starting here?

Because simply put, you need this skill set before you can move onto doing anything else.

### **Before you Start**

To pull this off, first test and correct your SQW:
- run this in wow, it should return 400

```/dump GetCVar("SpellQueueWindow")```

- and then Set your SQW to 400 if it isnâ€™t:

```/console SpellQueueWindow 400```

I'm not going to go into detail about this and why some folks modify it from the standard of 400. Let it be known that if your Spellqueuewindow is not set to 400, you are dead wrong.

### **Why should you Double Pyroblast**

- There is no DPS or GCD difference between doing [Scorch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2948/scorch) > [Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast) > [Fireblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast) + [Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast) and [Scorch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2948/scorch) + [Fireblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast) > [Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast) > [Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast), both combos do the exact same damage, and both combo's take exactly _**3 GCD's**_. However there is a KEY difference between where [Fireblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast) is placed during the combos. This slight change makes all the difference for [Feel The Burn](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383391/feel-the-burn) maintenance, and is the main reason why we do this.

### **How to Double Pyroblast**
![Double Pyro](https://github.com/Tymazen/images/assets/67207109/1ccb7f18-7a63-44ed-acb1-527b1b412f86)

Find a target dummy who's HP does not move, then talent into [Firestarter](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205026/firestarter) and [Alexstrasza's Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=235870/alexstraszas-fury). We're doing this just to make learning this combo easier so you are not waiting on [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) to come back off cooldown to try again. These talents are not required to perform this combo inside [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion).

Here's the fun part:
- Chuck a [Phoenix's Flames](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=194466/phoenixs-flames) at the dummy, and take a breath.
- Tap [Fireball](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=133/fireball)
- Tap [Fireblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast) Halfway through your fireball castbar.
- Spam press [Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast) and continue to press it until you've seen two leave your character.

And that's it! Congrats! You've done a double pyro! Repeat this as many times as you need to commit it to muscle memory, and try it with [Scorch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2948/scorch) and [Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast) hardcasts while in [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) as well! Do note you can and vary where you place [Fireblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast) in the castbar for [Feel The Burn](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383391/feel-the-burn) maintenance, and should place it later for longer casts like [Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast). Just make sure you don't cast it so late that the combo breaks!

### **When can I double Pyroblast?**
- You can only double pyroblast when all spells are guaranteed to crit namely, during [Firestarter](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205026/firestarter) and [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion).
- In [Firestarter](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205026/firestarter), you can only use [Fireball](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=133/fireball) and [Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast).
- In [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion), You can use [Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast), [Fireball](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=133/fireball), and [Scorch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2948/scorch) as your hardcast for the double pyro trick, but you _**can not**_ use [Flamestrike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2120/flamestrike), since it hits instantly and has no grace period, it just munches [Heating up](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48107/heating-up)/[Hot Streak](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48107/heating-up). You can consume the [Hot Streaks](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=48107/heating-up) with [Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast) or [Flamestrike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2120/flamestrike) regardless of what spell you used for the hardcast.
- Remember, this does not work in filler! All spells must have a 100% critical hit chance for this combo to work.

### **When should I double Pyroblast?**
- If you won't munch [Sun King's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383886/sun-kings-blessing) stacks
- During [Firestarter](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205026/firestarter) as called for
- During [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) when you wont overcap [Fireblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast) charges.
- When hardcasting [Fireball](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=133/fireball) or [Pyroblast]((https://www.wowhead.com/spell=11366/pyroblast)) in [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion)
