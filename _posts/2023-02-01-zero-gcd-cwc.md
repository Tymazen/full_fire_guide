# 0GCD / CWC, wtf does that even mean?

Most spells in world of warcraft activate "The Global Cooldown" aka the GCD. The global cooldown is 1.5 seconds, reduced by your haste (1.5/(1+haste%)), and cannot go lower than 0.75s. However some spells do __not__ activate the global cooldown, and are not affected by the global cooldown being currently active. Fire is rife with spells that are "0-GCD" or unaffected by the global cooldown. Namely [Fireblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast), [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion), [Ice Cold](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=414658/ice-cold), [Alter time](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108978/alter-time), [Counter Spell](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2139/counterspell), [Ice Floes](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108839/ice-floes), and [Shimmer](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=212653/shimmer).

All this really means, is on-gcd spells, abilities, items, etc cannot be used at the same time. Your current GCD must finish before the next can begin. However 0 GCD spells __CAN__ be used at the same time as on-gcd spells, or at anytime during their GCD, and they should be used as such to maximize the amount of on-gcd spells you're getting.

One caveat to this, even less spells are "castable while casting". CWC simply means you can use it while you have a cast bar active. Very few spells in the game are able to do this; however, Fire yet again has a few. Namely [Ice Floes](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108839/ice-floes), [Shimmer](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=212653/shimmer), [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) and [Fireblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast). The skinny on this is that [Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190319/combustion) must ALWAYS be used with a __cast__ and [Fireblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108853/fire-blast), [Ice Floes](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108839/ice-floes) and [Shimmer](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=212653/shimmer) must always be used with a __cast or while another GCD is active__.

Do note, 0GCD does not mean it is CWC. They are different identifiers that you have to pay attention to. If you are ever curious as to whether a spell is 0GCD, CWC, or both, you can always find the details on [Wowhead](https://www.wowhead.com/)!
